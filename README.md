# NeuropathyClassification
Manuscript and accompanying figures and tables for my undergraduate research on the application of RandomForest algorithm for the classification of optic neuropathy eyes using clinical measures

## What is this research about? 
This paper outlines my investigation of clinical measures to differentiate eyes with glaucoma from eyes with another optic neuropathy and from healthy eyes. To investigate the value of these clinical measurements and weigh their relative importances, I developed a RandomForest classification model using the R language, eventually creating a RF model that accurately differentiated patients in one of three groups.
